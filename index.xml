Resources Presentation Slides Bug Reporting Due to the current working at home predicament, it can be hard for lecturers and us to debug issues. Unfortunately receiving messages containing &amp;lsquo;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&amp;rsquo; is unhelpful and time wasting. Therefore, in this session we will cover how to bug report.
Tip Remember, before asking for help to attempt to try and solve the problem yourself (such as reading documentation, trying our top 5 mistakes and Ducking for answers).</description></item></channel></rss>
