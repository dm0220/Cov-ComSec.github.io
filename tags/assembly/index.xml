Ben did a demo with some challenges, and then we released some CTF challenges to solve.
Credential Leak via Memory Inspection The first demo showed how we can use a decompiler to understand how a binary functions, and then use a debugger to inspect memory at runtime in order to find credentials. You can download the demo binary here.</description></item><item><title>Assembly &amp; Shellcoding</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_assembly_and_shellcoding/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_assembly_and_shellcoding/</guid><description>This week Ben led a session on some basic assembly shellcoding. The first section of the session covered some foundational theory content on CPU architecture, registers, and memory. After this, assembly was introduced - we used x86_64 assembly with Intel syntax. In this article we will go through one method of solving each assembly challenge. The shellcode solutions will be released at a later date.
