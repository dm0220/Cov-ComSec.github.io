The term stack smashing was first coined in the Phrack article Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit. It is a term used to describe the technique of overflowing a buffer, writing shellcode onto the stack (and sometimes a NOP sled), and then overwriting the return address of a the stack frame with the address near the start of the payload.</description></item><item><title>Reverse Engineering Basics</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_reverse_engineering/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_reverse_engineering/</guid><description>The session at ComSec this week went into some basic reverse engineering methods. Ben did a demo with some challenges, and then we released some CTF challenges to solve.
Credential Leak via Memory Inspection The first demo showed how we can use a decompiler to understand how a binary functions, and then use a debugger to inspect memory at runtime in order to find credentials.

The first section of the session covered some foundational theory content on CPU architecture, registers, and memory. After this, assembly was introduced - we used x86_64 assembly with Intel syntax. In this article we will go through one method of solving each assembly challenge. The shellcode solutions will be released at a later date.
